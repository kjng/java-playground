Dashboard configuration data is used to configure certain aspects of dashboards
for this project. The following can be configured:<br>
<br>
<b>Templates:</b> Dashboard templates are used to populate newly created dashboards
with default title, tabs, pre-configured widgets, and layout. You can specify
different templates for the different types of available dashboards. This makes it
easier to get useful information from dashboards quickly.<br>
<br>
<b>Widget Catalog Entries:</b> You can add new entries to the widget catalog in the
dashboard which are variations of existing widgets but with pre-configured
settings. These will appear for all users when they click "Add Widget" in the
dashboard. For example, you can add a news feed that is pre-configured to
show your project's news, so that project members do not need to type in the URL.
